This mod is inspired by Dead by Daylight.

- Adds 2 status effects: **Endurance** & **Deep Wound**.  
- An enchantment **Undying** is added which gives you the **Endurance** effect.  
- 2 types of potions are also added: Potion of Endurance which gives you the **Endurance** effect, and Potion of Bleeding which gives you the **Deep Wound** effect.  

Em...the end, I'm really not good at writing README. For more information, see the Wiki page.
