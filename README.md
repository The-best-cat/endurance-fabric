# Deep Wound
## Status Effects
This mod adds 2 new status effects that are inspired by Dead by Daylight. These status effects **only apply to players** for now.
- **Endurance**
- **Deep Wound**

### Endurance
When you recieve **fatal damage**, Endurance will **prevent you from dying** and **set your health to 1**. After that, **Deep Wound** will be applied to you, and **all Endurance effects** will be **removed**.

**If you already have Deep Wound, Endurance will no longer prevent death.**

### Deep Wound
**All other status effects** will be **removed** and you will **gain 20 bleed point**. You will **lose 1 bleep point every second**. When all **bleed point is lost**, **you die**. 
- After taking damage, **bleed point loss speed** will be **increased by 50%**. 
- Taking damage again will instantly **lose 50% current bleed point**. 
- Taking damage the 3rd time will **immediately kill you**.

While **sprinting**, **eating** or **drinking**, the **time required to lose 1 bleed point** is increased to **2.5 seconds**. After **increasing mending progress**, **taking damage from mobs**, or **damaging any non-passive mobs**, bleed point loss will be **paused for 2 seconds**.

While under the **Deep Wound** effect, any **health restoration** is converted to **75% mending progress**; this conversion is **increased to 120% while sneaking**. If **remaining still and sneaking**, you will **gradually gain up to 20 mending progress within 5 seconds**.

If mending progress is **not increased for 5 seconds**, you will start to lose all mending progress within 10 seconds at most. 

Once mending progress **reaches 20**, **Deep Wound** is **removed**. **50% of your remaining bleed point** is converted to **permanent absorption (at least 4 given)**, and you gain **Regeneration IV** and **Speed I** for **3 seconds**.

## Enchantment
### Undying I/II/III 
**Applies to:** Chestplate  
**Description:** If you wear a chestplate with **Undying** enchantment, you will gain **Endurance** that **lasts indefinitely**. After **Endurance** is triggered, this enchantment will be **deactivated for 2/1.5/1 minutes**.

## Potion
### Potion of Endurance
**Ingrediant:** Awkward Potion + Gold Ingot (+ Glowstone Dust)  
**Description:** Gain **Endurance** effect for **3/8** minutes.

### Potion of Bleeding
**Ingrediant:** Awkward Potion + Redstone Dust (+ Glowstone Dust)  
**Description:** Suffer from **Deep Wound** effect for **20/50** seconds.

## Special
You will now gain **Endurance** by eating these:
- **10 seconds** from **golden carrots**
- **30 seconds** from **golden apples**
- **2 minutes** from **enchanted golden apples**

Upon **killing a mob**, **5 seconds** of **Endurance** will be applied to you with a **20% chance**. The chance will be **increased to up to 80% maximum** as your health goes down. Once **Endurance** is triggered, this effect will be deactivated for **3 minutes**.
